# I am maintaing these files as updated, corrected, and cleaned versions of the originals.

# Notes:
Update 1) Richard J. Smith (School of Social Work, Wayne State University) identified 7 duplicated cases (See DuplicatedCases.csv) in my orignal publication.  These cases have been removed from all relevant files. In each case, the main data (race and armed-status) was consistent in both copys of the data, with the exception of J. Ferrell, who was considered unarmed in one case and armed with only hands and feet in the second case. In the revised data, he is concidered unarmed.

# I am maintaing these files as updated, corrected, and cleaned versions of the originals.

# Notes:
Update 1) Richard J. Smith (School of Social Work, Wayne State University) identified 7 duplicated cases (See DuplicatedCases.csv) in my orignal publication.  These cases have been removed from all relevant files. In each case, the main data (race and armed-status) was consistent in both copys of the data, with the exceptions of: 1) J. Ferrell, who was considered unarmed in one case and armed with only hands and feet in the second case. In the revised data, he is concidered unarmed. 2) W. Jackson who was shot while reaching for a cellphone in his car. In one case, he was considered armed since a knife was found in his car, but review of the new reports indicate that he was not in possession of the knife when shot. He is now coded as unarmed.

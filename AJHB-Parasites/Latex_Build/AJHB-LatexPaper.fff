In some of their work, TFE include intermediate nodes (often as psychological modules) as well. For example, parasites are thought to affect democratization through a psychological mechanism related to xenophobia, but the proposed causal direction is as depicted here. ]

\caption{\label{resDem}  Posterior distributions of the probability of selecting categorical responses as a function of parasite prevalence.  We see that: 1) preference for authoritarianism decline as a function of increasing parasite prevalence [in units of frequency $\in (0,1)$ ]; 2) preference for democracy increase as a function of increasing parasite prevalence; and, 3) indifference/apathy toward the political system grow relative to preference for authoritarianism as parasite prevalence in a district increases.  }

\caption{\label{resCol}  Posterior distributions of the cumulative probability of an individual responding below a given ordered categorical threshold on the 1 to 10 scale measuring preference for state or free market solutions, respectively.  As red shifts to blue, preferences shift from the market fixing/controlling economic problems (individualism) to the state fixing/controlling of economic problems (collectivism). Each group of lines corresponds to one of the ordered categorical responses available to respondents, plotted as a function of parasite prevalence.  We find that: 1) the majority of the population, regardless of parasite prevalence, favors state control of economic issues, as the majority of the cumulative probability density is accounted for by the responses corresponding to increased state control; 2) the response profiles vary only slightly as a function of parasite prevalence; and, 3) to the minor extent that increased parasite prevalence varies with social preferences on the individualism/collectivism spectrum, it varies positively with preferences for market individualism, as can be seen by the slightly downward sloping lines (from left to right), which indicate that more cumulative probability is accounted for by higher item rankings (free market preferences) when parasite prevalence is high. }

As red shifts to blue, individuals report an increasing equality of men and women, from ``Not at All,'' to ``Fully.'' We find that: 1) across districts about 18\% of respondents think that equality of men and women is never ensured (``Not at all''), and 20\% of respondents think it is always ensured (``Fully''), with the majority of the population falling somewhere in between; 2) there is almost no variation in gender equality as a function of parasite prevalence across districts; and, 3) to the extent that any difference in gender equality exists as a function of parasite prevalence, there is a slight but non-reliable trend towards increased gender equality in districts where parasite prevalence is high. }

As red shifts to blue, individuals report an increasing level of achieved education. Each group of lines corresponds to one of the ordered categorical responses available to respondents (0 years through 12 years of primary/secondary education, plus 3 ordered classes of post-secondary education), plotted as a function of parasite prevalence.  We can see that: 1) across districts, approximately equal levels of primary education are achieved, regardless of parasite prevalence (this is shown by the cluster of categorical thresholds for which Cumulative Probability $<0.2$); 2) there is evidence of slightly lower educational achievement as a function of increasing parasite prevalence for secondary school levels of education (this is shown by the cluster of categorical thresholds for which Cumulative Probability $>0.3$ and $<0.7$); and, 3) there are only slight differences in higher educational achievement as a function of parasite prevalence (this is shown by the cluster of categorical thresholds for which Cumulative Probability $>0.8$).}

Every other group of lines corresponds to the posterior distribution of one of the other ordered categorical responses available to respondents describing their level of religiosity, plotted as a function of parasite prevalence. We find that:  1) across districts there is almost no variation in the proportion of the population with ``No Religion,'' as a function of parasite prevalence; 2) there is almost no variation in the proportion of the population that self identifies as ``Very Devout,'' as a function of parasite prevalence across districts; and, 3) to the extent that any differences in religiosity exist as a function of parasite prevalence, there is a slight trend for individuals in high parasite regions to mark ``Devout'' as opposed to ``Not very devout,'' when describing their religiosity (the absolute value of this effect as one moves from parasite-free regions to high parasite regions is about $2.5\%$). }
